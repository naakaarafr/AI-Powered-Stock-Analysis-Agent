* **Large Language Model (LLM):** Google Gemini (specifically `gemini-2.0-flash` as configured, can be changed)
* **Key Libraries:**
    * `python-dotenv`: For managing environment variables.
    * `crewai`, `crewai-tools`: For building and managing AI agent crews.
    * `langchain-google-genai`: For integrating Google's generative AI models.

## Prerequisites

* **Python:** Version 3.9 or higher recommended.
* **API Keys:**
    * **Google API Key (Critical):** For accessing Google Gemini LLM.
        * Enable the "Generative Language API" (sometimes referred to as "Vertex AI API" or similar for Gemini models) in your Google Cloud Console.
    * **Serper API Key (Optional, Recommended):** For enabling web search capabilities for agents. Get one from [serper.dev](https://serper.dev/).
    * **SEC API Key (Optional):** For enabling tools to analyze SEC 10-K and 10-Q filings. Get one from [sec-api.io](https://sec-api.io/).
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration

The application uses a `.env` file to manage API keys and other configurations.

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of the project.
2.  **Add your API keys** to the `.env` file. See `config.py` for variables used.

    ```env
    # .env file
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
    SERPER_API_KEY="YOUR_SERPER_API_KEY_HERE"          # Optional, for web search
    SEC_API_API_KEY="YOUR_SEC_API_KEY_HERE"        # Optional, for SEC filing tools

    # The following are set by config.py to force Gemini usage with CrewAI
    # You typically do not need to set these in your .env file
    # OPENAI_API_KEY=""
    # OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=""
    # OPENAI_API_BASE=""
    ```

    * Replace `"YOUR_..._KEY_HERE"` with your actual API keys.
    * If you don't have/want to use `SERPER_API_KEY` or `SEC_API_API_KEY`, you can omit them or leave them blank. The application will issue warnings but continue with limited functionality.

## Usage

The application can be run in two modes: CLI mode or Interactive mode.

### CLI Mode

Run `main.py` with arguments. Use `python main.py -h` or `python main.py --help` to see all available options.

**Syntax:**

python main.py -s <STOCK1> [STOCK2 ...] [options]
Common Options:

-s, --stocks: (Required) List of stock ticker symbols (e.g., AAPL MSFT GOOGL).
-q, --quick: Run quick analysis.
-c, --comprehensive: Run comprehensive analysis (slower, more detailed, enables SEC tools if API key is present).
-g, --goals: Investment goals (default: "long-term growth").
-r, --risk: Risk tolerance (choices: conservative, moderate, aggressive, high; default: moderate).
-t, --horizon: Investment time horizon (choices: short-term, medium-term, long-term, 5+ years; default: long-term).
-a, --amount: Investment amount (default: "$10,000").
--timeout: Analysis timeout in seconds (default: 300; comprehensive analysis gets 2x this value).
--no-timeout: Disable timeout for analysis.
-o, --output: Save results to a specific file.
-v, --verbose: Enable verbose output during execution.
Examples:

Quick analysis for Apple and Microsoft with default investor profile:

Bash

python main.py -s AAPL MSFT -q
Comprehensive analysis for Tesla, specifying investor profile and a longer timeout:

Bash

python main.py -s TSLA -c --goals "aggressive growth" --risk high --timeout 600
Comprehensive analysis for multiple stocks with no timeout and saving to a custom file:

Bash

python main.py -s NVDA AMD INTC -c --no-timeout -o ./analysis_reports/semiconductors_report.txt
Interactive Mode
If you run main.py without any arguments, it will start in interactive mode.

Bash

python main.py
The application will then guide you through:

Entering stock symbols.
Setting up your investor profile (goals, risk tolerance, horizon, amount).
Choosing the analysis type (Quick or Comprehensive).
Selecting timeout options for comprehensive analysis.
Output
Console: Analysis progress and final results are printed to the console.
File:
If the -o flag is used in CLI mode, results are saved to the specified file.
Otherwise (and in interactive mode if chosen), results are automatically saved to a timestamped .txt file in an analysis directory created in the project root (e.g., analysis/quick_analysis_20250530_143000.txt).
Running Diagnostics
Before running the main application, especially if you encounter issues, you can run the debug_api.py script. This script tests:

Internet connectivity.
Validity and connectivity for Google, Serper, and SEC API keys.
Basic CrewAI and Gemini integration.
Custom tool functionality.
Agent and task creation.
Bash

python debug_api.py
This will provide a summary of which components are working correctly and offer troubleshooting tips for failed tests.

Key Components
Agents (agents.py)
Specialized AI entities with specific roles, goals, and backstories. They use the configured LLM (Gemini) and tools to perform their duties.

Research Analyst: Focuses on data gathering.
Financial Analyst: Focuses on metrics and valuation.
Investment Advisor: Focuses on recommendations.
Market Strategist: Focuses on macro trends.
Tasks (tasks.py)
Specific assignments given to agents. Each task has a description, an expected output, and is assigned to an agent.

Research Task: Gather comprehensive information.
Financial Analysis Task: Perform in-depth financial evaluation.
Investment Recommendation Task: Generate advice based on analysis and profile.
Market Analysis Task: Assess market conditions.
Workflows (create_analysis_workflow, create_quick_analysis_workflow) assemble these tasks.
Tools (tools.py)
Functions that agents can use to interact with the external world or perform specific calculations.

financial_calculator: For math operations.
analyze_stock_metrics: Basic stock data parsing.
SerperDevTool: For web searches (if Serper API key is provided).
SEC10KTool / SEC10QTool: RAG tools to search within SEC filings (if SEC API key and sec-api package are available). These tools fetch the latest 10-K/10-Q filing for a stock, process its content, and allow agents to query it.
Error Handling and Timeouts
main.py includes robust error handling to catch common issues like missing API keys, connection failures, and task execution errors.
It implements a cross-platform timeout mechanism for long-running analysis tasks, which can be configured via CLI arguments or disabled.
The debug_api.py script is the first line of defense for diagnosing setup and API key problems.
Potential Future Enhancements
More Advanced Tools:
Integration with financial data APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud) for real-time price data, historical data, and more detailed fundamentals.
Chart generation or technical analysis indicator calculation tools.
Expanded Agent Capabilities:
Sentiment analysis agent for news and social media.
Risk modeling agent.
User Interface: A web-based GUI (e.g., using Streamlit or FastAPI) for easier interaction.
Sophisticated Financial Models: Implement more complex valuation models (e.g., detailed DCF) directly within tools or tasks.
Portfolio Management Features: Allow users to track a portfolio and get rebalancing advice.
Backtesting: Add functionality to backtest strategies based on agent recommendations.
Caching: Implement caching for API calls (e.g., SEC filings, search results) to speed up repeated analyses and reduce API usage.
Asynchronous Operations: For improved performance when handling multiple stocks or long-running tasks.
